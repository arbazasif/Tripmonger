Troubleshooting:
1. If the error 'Cannot GET /' appears, it means that the database has not been setup.

To resolve the issue, start the server by entering the following commands:
>Open File Directory in CMD
>npm start
>node app.js

Once done, the error shows: 'Server running on port: 5000'
After this you may enter the following in your web browser:
http://localhost:5000/

2. if the error appears as the following

it means that there is a module missing.
In this case, modules will need to be installed. We can do it by entering the following:
> npm install (module name)
eg: npm install express
